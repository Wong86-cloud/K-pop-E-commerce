# 🛒 K-pop E-commerce (Final Year Project)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **K-pop e-commerce platform** developed as my Final Year Project.  
It aims to provide K-pop fans with an engaging online shopping experience that covers every step of the customer journey.  

From browsing albums and merchandise to completing purchases, tracking orders, and leaving reviews, the system demonstrates a practical implementation of **UI/UX design, backend logic, and SQL database management**.  

The backend is powered by a **custom SQL database (`kpop_ecommerce.sql`)**, which ensures efficient and structured handling of users, products, orders, and reviews.
